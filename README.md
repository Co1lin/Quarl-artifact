# The Quartz Quantum Circuit Optimizer

Quartz is a quantum circuit optimizer that automatically generates and verifies circuit transformations for an arbitrary quantum gate set. To optimize an input quantum circuit, Quartz uses these auto-generated circuit transformations to construct a search space of functionally equivalent quantum circuits.
Quartz uses a cost-based search algorithm to explore the space and discovers highly optimized quantum circuits.

## Install Quartz
